# HubSpot Integration Guide

This demo site includes HubSpot sandbox tracking, forms, and CTAs for marketing campaign demonstrations.

## External Form Integration

All forms on this site use **HubSpot's external form embed** approach, which means:
- Forms submit directly to your HubSpot sandbox instance
- Lead data is captured in real-time in HubSpot
- Marketing automation workflows can be triggered immediately
- No server-side proxy or API keys required
- Forms work with HubSpot's GDPR and consent features

## Configuration Required

To activate the HubSpot features, you need to set the following environment variables in your Render dashboard or `.env.local` file for local development:

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` | Your HubSpot portal ID (Hub ID) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_CONTACT_FORM_ID` | Form ID for the homepage contact form |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_AGENT_FORM_ID` | Form ID for the agent registration form |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_FINANCING_FORM_ID` | Form ID for the VA financing application form |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PROPERTY_INQUIRY_FORM_ID` | Form ID for the property inquiry form |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_CTA_ID` | CTA ID for property detail page CTAs |

### Local Development Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID=your_portal_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_CONTACT_FORM_ID=your_contact_form_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_AGENT_FORM_ID=your_agent_form_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_FINANCING_FORM_ID=your_financing_form_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PROPERTY_INQUIRY_FORM_ID=your_property_inquiry_form_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_CTA_ID=your_cta_id
```

### Render Deployment Setup

The environment variables are pre-configured in `render.yaml`. Set their values in the Render dashboard:

1. Go to your Render service dashboard
2. Navigate to **Environment** tab
3. Add the HubSpot environment variables with your actual values

## Creating HubSpot Assets

### Setting Up External Forms in HubSpot Sandbox

1. Log into your HubSpot sandbox account
2. Navigate to Marketing → Lead Capture → Forms
3. Create forms for each page type:
   - **General Contact Form** - For homepage (name, email, phone, message)
   - **Property Inquiry Form** - For property detail pages (name, email, property interest, message)
   - **Agent Registration Form** - For `/agents` page (name, email, phone, license #, broker info)
   - **VA Financing Application** - For `/financing` page (name, email, phone, property interest, loan amount)

4. For each form:
   - Click on the form you created
   - Click "Share" or "Embed" button
   - Select "Embed code"
   - Find the Form ID in the embed code (looks like: `formId: "abc123-def456-ghi789"`)
   - Copy the Form ID
   - Set the corresponding environment variable with the Form ID

### Region Configuration

If your HubSpot sandbox is in a different data center (EU, etc.), you can pass the `region` prop to the HubSpotForm component:

```typescript
<HubSpotForm 
  formId="your-form-id"
  region="eu1"  // or "na1" for North America (default)
/>
```

Available regions:
- `na1` - North America (default)
- `eu1` - Europe
- `ap1` - Asia Pacific

### Setting Up CTAs

1. In HubSpot, navigate to Marketing → Lead Capture → CTAs
2. Create a new CTA (e.g., "Schedule Property Tour", "Request More Info")
3. Customize the button text, style, and behavior
4. Copy the CTA ID from the embed code
5. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_CTA_ID` environment variable

### Getting Your Portal ID

1. In HubSpot, click on your account name in the top right
2. Go to Account & Billing
3. Your Hub ID (Portal ID) is displayed at the top
4. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUBSPOT_PORTAL_ID` environment variable

## Testing External Form Submissions

After configuring the environment variables:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser developer tools
3. Check the Network tab for HubSpot script loads:
   - Look for `js.hsforms.net/forms/embed/v2.js`
   - Verify `js.hs-scripts.com/{YOUR_PORTAL_ID}.js` loads
4. Verify forms render correctly on each page:
   - Homepage: General contact form
   - Property detail pages: Property inquiry form
   - `/agents`: Agent registration form
   - `/financing`: VA financing application form
5. Test form submissions:
   - Fill out and submit a form
   - Check the browser console for confirmation messages
   - Verify the submission appears in HubSpot (Contacts → Forms)
   - Confirm contact is created with form field data

## Form Submission Flow

When a user submits a form:

1. **Form Validation**: HubSpot validates required fields client-side
2. **Direct Submission**: Form data submits directly to HubSpot sandbox via AJAX
3. **Lead Creation**: HubSpot creates or updates contact record in real-time
4. **Workflow Triggers**: Any marketing automation workflows are triggered immediately
5. **Confirmation**: User sees thank you message or is redirected
6. **Analytics**: Submission is tracked in HubSpot analytics and reports

## Campaign Tracking

The HubSpot tracking code will automatically:
- Track page views across all pages (homepage, properties, agents, financing)
- Identify visitors and create anonymous contacts
- Track form submissions from all 4 forms
- Enable marketing automation triggers based on form submissions
- Support A/B testing and personalization
- Track property views for lead scoring (which properties generate most interest)
- Enable retargeting campaigns based on visitor behavior

## Marketing Automation Examples

With these external forms, you can create workflows like:

1. **New Property Inquiry**: 
   - Trigger: Property inquiry form submitted
   - Action: Send automated email with property details
   - Action: Notify sales team
   - Action: Add to "Hot Leads" list

2. **Agent Registration**:
   - Trigger: Agent registration form submitted

3. **VA Financing Application**:
   - Trigger: VA financing form submitted
   - Action: Send financing guide PDF
   - Action: Schedule follow-up call task
   - Action: Add to "VA Loan Prospects" list

4. **Lead Nurturing**:
   - Trigger: Contact form submitted but no follow-up
   - Action: Wait 3 days, send property recommendations
   - Action: Wait 7 days, send success stories
   - Action: Wait 14 days, send limited time offer

## Demo Scenarios

1. **Lead Capture**: Contact forms on homepage and property pages
2. **Property Interest**: CTAs on individual listing pages
3. **Campaign Attribution**: Track which properties generate most interest
4. **Visitor Behavior**: See how users navigate between properties
